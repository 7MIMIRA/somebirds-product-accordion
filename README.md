# somebirds-product-accordion

## Repo Setup
```
npm install
```

Make sure to install **Mongo** on your system. Please refer [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for documentation to get started if not already installed.

```
npm start
npm run db:seed
```

At this point there should be a database set up locally called somebirds, with a collection called shoes inside. There should be about 100 entries, with the first being a realistic example of meta-data for a shoe. The server should now be running. Open the application in your browser at **localhost:3002**. What should be available there is an accordion component that contains some of the data listed of the realistic example.
**Model Name**: mens-wool-runners.
